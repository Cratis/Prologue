# 📜 Cratis Prologue

**Captures what an existing system *actually does* — its HTTP commands, database changes, and telemetry — and interprets that into an event model Cratis can perform.**

Before the main action, a play has a **prologue** — the opening that recounts everything that happened before
the curtain rose. Cratis Prologue is that opening act for an existing system. It stands beside a running, often
legacy application, captures what it *truly does* — SQL Server and Postgres changes, HTTP commands,
OpenTelemetry traces — and interprets those captures into an **event model** that can be brought into
[Cratis Studio](https://github.com/Cratis/Studio) or used from the Cratis CLI (and, from there, performed live
by **Stage**). It's how a brownfield system enters the Cratis story — by writing down the backstory it's been
telling all along.

It captures **metadata, not data**: which tables and columns changed, which endpoints were called, which spans
fired — never the actual values. The story, not anyone's private lines.

Prologue is self-contained: it has no dependency on Studio and does not require Orleans or any other hosting
model. Everything runs either as a downloadable CLI (the Extractor) or as containers (the Extractor,
Interpreter, and Receiver).

## 📜 Why "Prologue"?

Three reasons, and they all line up:

- **A prologue tells the backstory.** It recounts what happened before the play begins. Prologue captures the
  system that already exists — the story so far — before you model it in Cratis.
- **It comes first.** Its output is an event model — the script the rest of the cast performs. Prologue always
  opens the show: capture and interpret, then hand the model on.
- **The Cratis storytelling family.** Cratis names its products after telling a story: **Chronicle** records
  new events, **Arc** shapes the plot, **Screenplay** is the script, **Stage** performs it, **Studio**
  storyboards it… **Prologue** writes the opening act from a system that predates them all. It joins the cast.

## 🎥 From a running system to a script

The Extractor watches a brownfield system from a few angles at once, correlates what it sees into captures, and
the Interpreter reads those captures back into an event model:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Sys["🗄️ existing system"] --> Ext{{"📜 Extractor<br/>DB · HTTP · OTel — metadata only"}}
    Ext -->|"capture .jsonl files"| Folder[["📁 mounted folder"]]
    Ext -.->|"HTTP"| Rcv["📥 Receiver"] --> Mongo[("🍃 MongoDB")]
    Folder --> Interp{{"🧠 Interpreter<br/>(+ optional LLM)"}}
    Interp -->|"extraction-result.json"| Model["📄 event model<br/>→ Studio · CLI · Stage"]
```

- **Database change capture** — watches SQL Server (CDC) and Postgres (logical replication) and records, per
  transaction, which tables and columns changed.
- **HTTP command capture** — sits in front of the system as a YARP reverse proxy and records the `POST` /
  `PUT` / `DELETE` operations passing through.
- **OpenTelemetry capture** — acts as an OTLP proxy, capturing span metadata (and an allowlisted set of
  attributes) and forwarding the telemetry on unchanged.

The streams are correlated by a time-window heuristic and shared trace id — a command plus the database
transactions committed within its window become one **capture** — so the intent and the changes it caused are
read as a single act. The Interpreter then reconstructs those captures into an `ExtractionResult`: modules,
features, and slices with their commands, events, read models, and projections.

## 🎭 The cast (projects)

| Project | Package / Image | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Source/Contracts` | `Cratis.Prologue.Contracts` (NuGet) | The capture contract — `Capture`, `Observation`, payload types, and the canonical JSON (`CaptureSerialization`) and capture-file (`CaptureFiles`) formats. |
| `Source/Configuration` | `Cratis.Prologue.Configuration` (NuGet) | Well-defined configuration types for `cratis-prologue.json` plus serialization helpers to read and write it. |
| `Source/Storage` | `Cratis.Prologue.Storage` (NuGet) | MongoDB persistence of captures — used by the Receiver and by consumers such as Studio. |
| `Source/Extractor` | `cratis/prologue-extractor` (Docker) | Runs next to the system being captured. Captures SQL Server CDC, Postgres logical replication, HTTP commands (reverse proxy), and OpenTelemetry — writes capture files or posts to the Receiver. |
| `Source/Interpreter.Contracts` | `Cratis.Prologue.Interpreter.Contracts` (NuGet) | The extraction result contract — `ExtractionResult` and the `Extracted*` model tree, plus serialization helpers for the result file. |
| `Source/Interpreter` | `cratis/prologue-interpreter` (Docker) | Run-to-completion job that reads capture files from a mounted folder, interprets them into an event model, and writes the extraction result to a mounted output folder. |
| `Source/Receiver` | `cratis/prologue-receiver` (Docker) | HTTP endpoint the Extractor can post captures to directly, instead of capturing to file. |

## ⚙️ Configuration — `cratis-prologue.json`

All tools are configured with a dedicated `cratis-prologue.json` file — not `appsettings.json`. The
`Cratis.Prologue.Configuration` package contains the configuration types and does the serialization, so any
consumer (Studio, the CLI, or your own tooling) can write configuration files in the exact format the tools
expect.

```json
{
    "prologue": {
        "output": { "kind": "Json", "json": { "directory": "./captures" } },
        "correlation": { "windowMilliseconds": 2000 },
        "sqlServer": [ { "name": "main", "connectionString": "..." } ],
        "postgres": [],
        "openTelemetry": { "enabled": true }
    },
    "llm": {
        "enabled": true,
        "kind": "Anthropic",
        "accessToken": "sk-...",
        "modelId": "claude-opus-4-6"
    }
}
```

- The **Extractor** looks for `cratis-prologue.json` in its working directory (override with the
  `PROLOGUE_CONFIG` environment variable) and binds the `prologue` section.
- The **Interpreter** reads the same file (mounted into its container at `/config/cratis-prologue.json`) and
  binds the `llm` section for optional LLM-based refinement. Supported `kind` values: `Ollama` (default, native
  chat API), `OpenAI`, `AzureOpenAI` (the `modelId` is the deployment name), `OpenAICompatible` (any `/v1`
  endpoint), and `Anthropic` — each configured with an `endpoint` and an `accessToken` as needed; the hosted
  providers default to their public endpoints and models.

## 🎟️ Data flow

```text
Extractor ──(capture .jsonl files)──▶ mounted folder ──▶ Interpreter ──▶ extraction result .json
    └──────(HTTP)──▶ Receiver ──▶ MongoDB
```

The Extractor emits one `CapturedEntry` per line (JSON lines), partitioned per source kind. The Interpreter
reads a folder of those files, reconstructs the correlated captures, and produces an `ExtractionResult`.

## 🚀 Building

```shell
dotnet build                # Debug — includes inline specs
dotnet test                 # run the specs
dotnet build -c Release     # Release — warnings are errors
```

Container images are built from the repository root:

```shell
docker build -f Source/Extractor/Dockerfile   -t cratis/prologue-extractor .
docker build -f Source/Interpreter/Dockerfile -t cratis/prologue-interpreter .
docker build -f Source/Receiver/Dockerfile    -t cratis/prologue-receiver .
```

## ✅ Quality gates

```shell
dotnet build -c Release     # zero warnings, zero errors
dotnet test                 # all specs green
```
